# Simple Todo List for practice

This is a simple todo list app that I made for practice.

It is written in TypeScript and uses React and Tailwind CSS.

## Deployment on vercer

This is the url of the app: https://react-simple-to-do-list.vercel.app/

To deploy it, just fork the repo and push it to vercel.

## Running the app locally

To run the app locally, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer.

After that, you can run the following commands:

- `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- `npm run dev` to start the development server.
- `npm run build` to build the production version of the app.
- `npm run preview` to preview the production version of the app.
